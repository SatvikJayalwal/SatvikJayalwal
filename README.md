## SDET Profile Summary

I am a tenacious and detail-driven SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) with hands-on experience building scalable, maintainable automation frameworks for Frontend (UI) and Backend (API, Database) testing. I specialize in delivering high-quality software through test automation, continuous integration, and strong engineering principles. My work reflects a deep commitment to clean code, structured testing, and real-world reliability.

Core Skills:

- UI automation with Selenium, PyTest, Playwright
- API testing using Postman, Python Requests, Newman
- Test types: Smoke, Sanity, Regression, Functional, Integration, Cross-browser
- Test planning, test case design, and requirement traceability
- CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker
- Backend testing and DB validation (MySQL, Linux CLI)
- BDD automation using Behave with Allure reporting
- Defect lifecycle management: logging, triage, reproduction, verification
- Agile development and SDLC: sprint planning, story-based automation

### Technical Skill Set

**Automation Tools & Languages:**  
Python, Selenium, PyTest, Behave (BDD), XPath Locators, CSS Selectors

**Framework Design:**  
Modular POM structure, reusable utility functions, fixtures, hooks, Excel-driven test suites, dynamic waits, assertions

**API Testing:**  
Postman, Python requests, REST API validation, JSON schema verification, status code checks

**CI/CD & DevOps:**  
Jenkins, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions ‚Äî building and managing automation pipelines with source control

**Testing Lifecycle & Agile:**  
Jira for bug tracking and sprint tasks, Agile/Scrum methodology, test planning and execution within sprint cycles

**Other Areas:**  
Linux-based automation, MySQL database testing, command-line scripting, backend validation, web scraping

### Why I Stand Out as an SDET

- I don‚Äôt just automate ‚Äî I design test solutions that are scalable, reusable, and built for long-term reliability  
- I focus on clean, modular code to ensure smooth collaboration and maintainability across teams  
- I proactively log, debug, and report bugs to accelerate development feedback cycles  
- I bring strong ownership, a collaborative mindset, and consistent delivery in Agile teams

---

### Mindset

I believe the best SDETs combine developer-level thinking with user-centric testing and engineering-grade automation. I stay continuously updated with the latest tools, patterns, and practices to improve quality and shorten feedback loops. Whether working on a framework or testing critical business logic, I strive for precision, clarity, and impact.

Looking forward to contributing to a team where software quality is a priority, automation is embraced, and continuous learning is encouraged.
